# Catch-ME
This is my first official project for class. 

# About ME
I developed 'Catch-ME,' an engaging twist on the classic 'Whac-a-Mole' game, designed to challenge and improve users' motor skills and mouse-clicking speed. This two-player interactive game offers a competitive experience, combining eye-catching CSS features with fast-paced action, providing a unique and enjoyable gaming experience.

# Techniques Used
I did a lot of research on how to make my game look and operate. W3Schools and MDN are my bestfriends this far into the coarse. I had trouble doing things with DOM within Jacascript but I found some resources thatv helped. I was able to apply arrays to my game for my players and storing multiple scores.

# Unsolved Mysteries
I was able to get my player versus player to show but the quit button doesnt stop the timer. It only resets the score and timer but getting the timer to stop until player hits start again is my current obstacle. Also, I wasnt sure how to get my alert for turn ending to stop after the winner has been chosen.
