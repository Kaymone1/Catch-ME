# Catch-ME
This is my first official project for class. 

# About ME
This is a game I created that is a twist of what you may know as 'Whac-a-Mole'. My game "Catch-ME" is an interactive game that tests your motor skills and how well you can click a mouse. I made this game to challenge how fast you may believe Pikachu from Pokemon is. This game is for 2 players and you will battle for the most clicks. This game has some css features that will not only catch your eye but will try to dodge it at the same time.

# Techniques Used
I did a lot of research on how to make my game look and operate. W3Schools and MDN are my bestfriends this far into the coarse. I had trouble doing things with DOM within Jacascript but I found some resources thatv helped. I was able to apply arrays to my game for my players and storing multiple scores.

# Unsolved Mysteries
I was able to get my player versus player to show but the quit button doesnt stop the timer. It only resets the score and timer but getting the timer to stop until player hits start again is my current obstacle. Also, I wasnt sure how to get my alert for turn ending to stop after the winner has been chosen.
