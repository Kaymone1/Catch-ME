# Catch-ME
This is my first official project for class. 

#About ME
This is a game I created that is a twist of what you may know as 'Whac-a-Mole'. My game "Catch-ME" is an interactive game that tests your motor skills and how well you can click a mouse. I made this game to challenge how fast you may believe Pikachu from Pokemon is. This game is for 2 players and you will battle for the most clicks. This game has some css features that will not only catch your eye but will try to doge it at the same time.

#Techniques Used
I did a lot of research on how to make my game look and operate. W3Schools and MDN are my bestfriends this far into the coarse. I had trouble doing things with DOM within Jacascript but I found some resources thatv helped.

#Unsolved Mysteries
I wasn't able to get the player interaction to show but I was only able to show 1 players score. I've reached my other set goals but I had alot of difficulty displaying 2 players. My images also keep disappearing everytime I deploy.
